The node_modules folder is ignored when converting to a Zip file because the node_modules folder can be extremely large, containing thousands of files and directories. We can easily recreate the node_modules directory by installing the dependencies listed in the package.json file. Here are the steps:

# Navigate to the corresponding folder in the terminal,

### `cd TIC-TAC-TOE`

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser and start playing.
